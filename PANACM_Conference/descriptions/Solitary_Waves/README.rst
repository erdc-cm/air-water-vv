Solitary wave propagation over a flat bottom  benchmark case
===============================================================

A solitary wave is a theoretical wave shape (Boussinesq, 1872) that is often used in numerical wave simulations, partly because they have the unique property of being 'stand-alone' waves that maintain their shape and kinematics when propagated over a flat smooth surface.  By measuring the properties of the wave as it propagates, the absence of numerical dissipation during wave propagation can be confirmed.

The present problem consists of 2D rectangular numerical flume with height, H, of 2.0 m and a length, L, of 60.0 m, where the mean water depth, h, is equal to 1.0 m. At the left boundary, a solitary wave is generated with a height of 0.05 m imposing appropriately the flux parameters. Atmospheric conditions have been assigned to the top boundary of the domain and the bottom boundary act as a free-slip wall.
A sketch of the domain is given in the following figure.

This test case demonstrates the ability of PROTEUS to simulate the generation and propagation of a solitary wave as well as its absorption.
