Dambreak flow with obstacle - Ubbink (1997)
===========================================

The problem consists of a 0.292m x 1.146m (height x width) column of
water, initially at rest.  A small obstacle (0.024m x 0.048m) is
placed in the middle of the tank base.  Under the action of gravity
the water column interacts with the obstacle and collapses to a wall.
The computational domain is a 2D rectangular box with dimensions
0.584m x 0.584m.  The top of the domain is left open, when the rest of
the boundary patches act as free slip walls.  In the following figure, a
sketch of the dambreak initial conditions is shown.

This case tests the ability of PROTEUS to simulate the free-surface
evolution and during the interaction of the dambreak front with the
obstacle.  The results of the simulations can be visually compared
with the data in the following references.  For more details, see
runfiles or references.
