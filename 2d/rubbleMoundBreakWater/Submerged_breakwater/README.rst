Submerged breakwater
====================

This case consists in modeling a wave interaction with a low crested and porous structure. Non linear waves
are generated at the left boundary in a one-wavelenght long zone. The porosity of the media is 0.4. The front 
toe of the porous media is 2 wavelenghts after the end of the generation zone. The front slope is 1:2, the 
lenght of the crest is b=0.25m and the back slope is 2:3. the lenght between the absorption zone and the back 
of the media is 3.5 wavelenghts long. The absorption zone is 2 wavelenghts long. The mean water level is 
0.315m.

Many tests are done with different wave heights (0.03, 0.04, ..., 0.11, 0.12) and different wave periods 
(1.0, 1.5, 2.0).

This benchmark can only be used with the proteus branch lmaurel/improve_TankObs2D (https://github.com/lmaurel/proteus/tree/lmaurel/improve_TankObs2D)
