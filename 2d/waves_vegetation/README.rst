Flow Through Vegetation (Anderson and Smith, 2014)
==================================================

The problem's domain is a 63.4m long, 1.5m wide flume of varying depth. A
wave is generated at the far edge of the flume, which is at a depth of
1.95m. 
The deep section is 5.4m-long, followed by a 1:44 slope for 19.5m
that connects to a 12.2-m long, 1.5m-deep flat testing area. 
Within the testing area there are rods simulating idealized vegetation placed in a diamond formation. 
After the testing area there is a 11.3m, 1:20 slope with damping properties (to reduce reflected waves).

This study uses PROTEUS to model wave attenuation in shallow-water vegetated areas.
