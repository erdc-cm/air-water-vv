Vertical breakwater
===================

Numerical simulation (hybrid LS-VOF model) of hydrodynamic process
during the interactions between incident waves and vertical
breakwaters and the comparisons of the results with experimental data
in the in the nearshore zone are revealed and discussed. For the
vertical breakwater, the published data by Xie (1981) are used. The
experiment was conducted in a 38 m long, 0.8mwide and 0.6 m deep wave
flume. The water depth was equal to 0.45 m at the beginning of the
flume and reduced to 0.3 m at the flat bed near the breakwater with a
1:30 slope.  For more details, see runfiles or references.
