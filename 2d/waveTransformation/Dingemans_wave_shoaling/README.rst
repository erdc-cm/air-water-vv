Dingemans wave shoaling benchmark case
========================================

Sea waves transform when propagating from the offshore to the near shore environment as they interact with coastal structures. In a 2D flume, the main factors contributing to wave transformation are shoaling, reflection, transmission and breaking. The present case is the numerical reproduction of the Dingemans' experiment (Dingemans, 1994), which is a classic benchmark test for numerical models  and refers to non linear shoaling over a submerged shoal.  
The experimental setup is shown the figure below. The geometry represents a submerged bar with seaward and shoreward slopes of 1/20 and 1/10, respectively. 

The numerical domain of the simulation has a length, L, of 58.0 m. Upstream and downstream the shoal the domain has a height, H, of 1.26 m, where the mean water depth, h, is equal to 0.86 m. Over the shoal's crest the water depth, b, is equal to 0.2 m. At the left boundary regular non linear waves are generated with height of 0.082 m and period of 1.43 s using Fenton's method (Fenton, 1988). The bottom boundaries act as a no-slip walls.

where, L1=9.22 m, L2=5.79 m, L3=12.03, L4=4.0 m, L5=6.03 m, L6=8.74 and L7=12.19 m. 

This test case demonstrates the ability of PROTEUS to simulate the shoaling process of regular non linear waves over a submerged shoal as well as their absorption.
